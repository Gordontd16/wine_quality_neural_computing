1. Title: Wine Quality Data Set

3. Relevant Information: The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese 'Vinho Verde' wine. For more details, consult: [http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/] or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). We just used the white wine data.
